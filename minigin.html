        <h1>2D Engine in C++</h1>
        <hr>
        <h2>The goal</h2>
        <p>Creating a 2D engine and a small game to prove that it works. By using Open GL
          as a graphics renderer and some Game Programming Patterns (Robert Nystrom), Pengo
          an 80's arcade came to life.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h2>The process</h2>
        <p>As mentioned above, Game Programming Patterns, a book written by Robert Nystrom, was
        often the red wire through this project. The following patterns were implemented in the engine:</p>
        <ul style="text-align: left; font-size: 20px;">
          <li><b>Observer</b>: a seperate object that gets triggered once an event occurs, such as a kill.
            Once triggered, it will execute a certain action.</li>
          <li><b>State</b>: input will be handled seperately and depending on the current state the player
            is in, it will return a new or the same state. If it's the same state, then nothing will
             happen. If it's another state, an enter function will be called, changing for instance
              the graphics of the character.</li>
          <li><b>Component</b>: probably one of the most important patterns is this one. The component system
          allows to completely seperate functionality of different domains from each other, without
          them intervening. However one entity can still span over these multiple domains.</li>
          <li><b>Update Method</b>: super simple, but super necessary. This pattern is about Game Objects having their
          own Update function which will be called during the <u>gameloop</u>. In our case, this update
          function will call the components' update function (components are attached to a Game Object). Objects
          get a 'Destroyed' tag, so that an update won't be executed during that frame. </li>
          <li><b>Game Loop</b>: probably found in every game. A game loop processes the input of the player, it updates all Objects
          in the scene and it renders what's needed to come on the screen. This gameloop, makes sure the game runs at a consistent
          framerate or it makes sure that on an slower computer, the same amount of stuff happens in the
          same amount of real time. What I added as well is when there is time left (that means a loop went faster than the max frame-time), rather
          than sleeping, objects that are destroyed will be deleted in memory.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Other things added is the A* algorithm, but simplified. This algorithm is used for the enemy to travel towards its prey.
        Also the maze is procedurally generated by using the Prim's algorithm.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion and take aways</h2>
        <p>This was probably one of the better projects in order to understand engine design and get a better grasp on C++.
        By making the game I got to know two new algorithms which I never implemented before. </p>
