        <h1>Codename: Help Jacques</h1>
        <h2>What is Help Jacques?</h2>
        <p>Help Jacques is a personal <b>side project</b>, currently being made by myself.
          It's a <b>Serious Game</b> that is meant to be played by children at school around the age 12-16 years old,
          though it can be played by anyone. The goal of the game is that when played, the player learns about the main events
          that led to the <b>French Revolution</b> and all its consequences.
        </p>
        <h2>How will it be played?</h2>
        <p>The genre for this game will be <b>Point-to-Click-Adventure</b>.
            Famous examples of this are: 'Monkey Island', 'Grim Fandago', 'Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis' and 'A New Beginning'.
            Below you can see a gameplay video of Monkey Island.
        </p>
        <iframe class="video" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FpIUxjGfkXg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p>
            The game is meant to be played on a <b>mobile phone or tablet</b>, since computers are not always evident to be present at
            an average family home. The user navigates on a 2D image by pressing anywhere on the screen. The character will then move
            to that position or to the closest possible point.
            Items that are necessary for the story can be picked up by pressing on them. The character will then navigate towards the object and
            pick it up if possible.
        </p>
        <h2>The Story</h2>
        <p>
            Story is the most important in this game, since we want to achieve that the player learns about the French Revolution.
            I believe that we can remember stories the best when the experience is great. A movie is unforgettable with characters
            that you connect with. Things must happen that makes you feel for them. Therefore, a good script and some fine voice-acting
            will be in place here.
        </p>
        <p>
            Jacques will be the main-character you will play as. Jacques is a farmer, who has a wife and a recently born daughter.
            Yet, he as everyone else is struggling to pay his taxes. The state threatens to take his property if he cannot pay his due.
            One day Monique, Jacques' wife, asks him to go fetch some bread at the market. This is where he meets his local baker, Luc.
            He soons discovers that Luc has raised his prices. Luc mentions that King Louis has summoned the Estates-General and asks
            Jacques to join him for the gathering by sneaking in. It's from here that things will get interesting...
        </p>
        <h2>The Process of creating a game</h2>
        <p>Since I have a fulltime job and work on Saturdays as well, progress can only be made with time in between.
        Therefore, it's possible that it will take quite some time for one feature to be implemented. All progress that will be made though,
        will be posted on a blog. Click <a href="helpJacquesBlog.html"><b><u>here</u></b></a> to view that blog!
